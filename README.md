# AVR314-DTMF-Generator-for-Arduino
An update to the Atmel AVR314 Application Note
Original Application Note can be found here: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/AppNotes/doc1982.pdf

I do not take credit for the original software.  The original software was taken from the 
Microchip website and ported for use on th Arduino / ATmega328P.

Please feel free to contribute.
